# MP2.0

Some time ago, there was a little boy that wanted to learn how to program.
He had chosen a language (python) and learned its syntax, its inner workings and some little tricks.

Soon, he wanted to do something greater, something more useful than his little algorithms he had written until then,
and liked to hear music. So he decided to make a music player that would play the music of his in random order.

Although he thought that he was already pretty good in writing programs - and he actually achieved to write more of
the program than he initially thought - he had only written working code. For him, that was enough, but for me,
it's a nightmare.

So now, I am going to refactor this old code and make it not only more maintainable, but also better to look at.

Maybe there will be some additional features added to it. If you know of something, you can leave it in the issues tab.
But it won't be the focus of this project.

So, that's the story of this project. I hope it was interesting and maybe we will see us again.
